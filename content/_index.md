### 🌱 About Me

I’m **Guanyi**, an applied statistician whose work focuses on the methodological challenges that arise when cognitive data are collected across diverse educational, linguistic, and cultural contexts. My training in the **University of Michigan’s Applied Statistics program** has shaped how I think about scientific questions: not only through prediction, but through **identification, measurement structure, and diagnostics**.

My interest in biostatistics is grounded in a central idea reflected throughout my research and academic statements:  
**inference is only as strong as the measurement that supports it.**

Working with population-based cognitive aging studies in the U.S., Mexico, India, and Nepal, I became increasingly interested in how **floor effects, zero inflation, literacy-linked missingness, and measurement non-equivalence** reshape what we can conclude from statistical models. These challenges are not nuisances—they are where the science happens.  

This realization led me toward research that integrates **statistical modeling, psychometrics, and global health**, with the goal of developing tools that remain robust even when data are imperfect, heterogeneous, or culturally constrained.

Good measurement, to me, is a scientific commitment: a way to see people accurately and fairly across context.

### 🧭 What I’m Working On

At the **University of Michigan**, I work with **Dr. Emily Briceño** on methods-driven cognitive aging research that combines population data, statistical modeling, and measurement evaluation.

**🌏 Cross-National Modeling (HRS-HCAP, Mex-Cog, LASI-DAD):**  
I analyze Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subtypes using **multinomial logistic regression**, **generalized linear models**, and **latent variable approaches**. A central focus is ensuring **measurement comparability** across countries—evaluating factor structures, detecting DIF, diagnosing floor effects, and assessing missingness mechanisms that differ across educational and cultural contexts.  
This work has deepened my interest in **generalizability and robust inference** in heterogeneous populations.

**🇳🇵 Cognitive Assessment Adaptation in Nepal:**  
I lead analyses for the **Nepal HCAP adaptation**, evaluating newly developed visuospatial and attention tasks designed for low-literacy groups. My work includes **WLSMV estimation**, item-level diagnostics, structural validity assessment, and generating factor scores for downstream epidemiologic modeling.  
This project strengthened my interest in **measurement science and inference under data constraints**—themes that shape my broader research direction.

### 🔬 Research Interests

My methodological interests align closely with the research philosophy in my graduate statements and current projects:

- **Latent variable modeling:** CFA, IRT, factor score estimation  
- **Measurement validity & harmonization:** cross-national comparability, DIF, floor effects  
- **Generalized regression frameworks:** GLMs, multinomial models, robust standard errors  
- **Missing data & bias:** literacy-linked missingness, non-ignorable patterns  
- **Inference under heterogeneity:** cultural, educational, and contextual variability  
- **Applied problems in cognitive aging and global health**

Across topics, I aim to pair **rigorous statistical tools** with **context-aware inference**, ensuring models reflect the populations behind the data.

### ☕ Beyond the Data

Outside research, I value the slower rhythms that make careful thinking possible—long walks, cafés, and music that helps ideas settle. These moments remind me that statistics is both computational and conceptual: a way of asking precise questions about complex lives, and of bringing clarity where measurement is difficult but essential.
