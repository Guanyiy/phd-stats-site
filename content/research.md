## 🧠 Research Overview

My research focuses on cognitive aging, measurement validity across diverse populations, and statistical modeling for neuropsychological data. I work with HCAP-based cohorts (HRS-HCAP, Mex-Cog, LASI-DAD, Nepal HCAP) as well as experimental datasets involving complex behavior and statistical models.
