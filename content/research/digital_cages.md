**Overview:**  
This project analyzes high-resolution actigraphy data collected from mice in digitally monitored cages to identify underlying behavioral states. Through dimensionality reduction and clustering, we uncovered interpretable daily and circadian patterns in movement and rest cycles.

**Contributions:**  
- Cleaned and reshaped raw time-series sensor data  
- Performed dimensionality reduction using PCA and feature filtering  
- Clustered behaviors via k-means and hierarchical methods  
- Applied the NExOS algorithm to identify informative features

**Tools:** R, Python, PCA, clustering, time series modeling
