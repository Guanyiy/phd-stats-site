### 📘 Overview  
This project examines the **numerical behavior of European option pricing and hedging strategies** under **stochastic differential equation (SDE)** dynamics. Using the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) model, we simulated large-scale asset paths and evaluated how discretization, volatility, and trading frequency influence replication accuracy.

Although grounded in quantitative finance, the project served as an early foundation for my interest in **stochastic modeling, simulation-based inference, and algorithmic stability**, skills that continue to inform my work in statistical modeling and cognitive aging.

### 🔍 Key Contributions  
- Simulated **100,000+** GBM paths using the **Euler–Maruyama discretization**  
- Implemented **delta** and **delta–gamma neutral** hedging strategies and compared replication errors  
- Analyzed convergence properties of Monte Carlo estimators under varying volatility regimes  
- Evaluated sensitivity to time-step selection and hedging frequency, highlighting trade-offs between accuracy and computational cost  
- Produced reproducible Python pipelines with diagnostics and visual summaries
