This project focused on simulating European option pricing under stochastic dynamics (Geometric Brownian Motion), evaluating the effectiveness of different hedging strategies under realistic market fluctuations.

**Contributions:**
- Simulated over 100,000 asset price paths using the Euler–Maruyama scheme
- Implemented delta and delta-gamma neutral hedging strategies
- Visualized option price convergence and replication error under different volatility regimes
- Assessed the impact of discretization and hedging frequency on performance

**Tools:** Python, Monte Carlo methods, Black–Scholes framework, NumPy, Matplotlib
