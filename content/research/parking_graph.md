**Overview:**  
This project investigates MVP parking functions in the context of **Abelian Sandpile Models (ASM)** — a discrete dynamical system rooted in statistical physics and graph theory. By embedding parking function rules into ASM recurrence processes, we explored new connections between combinatorics and critical-state dynamics.

**Contributions:**
- Integrated MVP parking function constraints into classical ASM
- Simulated chip-firing dynamics and toppling sequences in Java
- Evaluated recurrence, stabilization behavior, and lattice structure
- Provided insight into the algebraic structure of sandpile groups

**Tools:** Java, ASM simulation, Discrete Math
