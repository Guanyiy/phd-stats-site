### 📘 Overview  
This project investigates **MVP parking functions** through the lens of the **Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM)**, a discrete dynamical system with deep connections to graph theory, chip-firing processes, and algebraic combinatorics.  

By embedding parking function preference rules into sandpile **recurrence and stabilization processes**, we explored how local toppling behavior maps onto global combinatorial structure. The work highlights parallels between **parking functions, recurrent configurations**, and the **sandpile group** of a graph.
