### 🧩 Overview  
This project builds a **cross-national statistical framework** for identifying predictors of **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** subtypes using harmonized cognitive and health data from **HRS-HCAP**, **Mex-Cog**, and **LASI-DAD**.  
The work integrates:

- **latent variable–based cognitive domain scores**,  
- **cross-national measurement harmonization**, and  
- **multinomial / ordinal regression modeling**,  

to evaluate how demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors predict memory-impaired and non-memory-impaired MCI across heterogeneous populations.

A central focus is understanding **how measurement differences, floor effects, and literacy-linked missingness shape inference**, and developing models whose conclusions remain stable across cultural and educational contexts.

### 📈 Key Contributions  
- Harmonized demographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors across three aging cohorts (age, rurality, vascular risk, depression, education).  
- Derived MCI classifications using domain-level cutpoints informed by **HCAP psychometrics** and international consensus standards.  
- Fit and compared **multinomial logistic**, **proportional-odds**, and **partial proportional-odds** models for 3-category cognitive outcomes.  
- Conducted sensitivity analyses addressing **floor effects**, **domain-specific skew**, **class imbalance**, and **missingness mechanisms**.  
- Built a reproducible **20+ page R Markdown pipeline**, integrating diagnostics, visualizations, and cross-site model comparisons.  
- Presented results in weekly cross-institutional meetings across Michigan, Brown, and Columbia.
