🕓 **Period:** *May 2025 – Present*

### 🧩 Overview  
This project develops a comparative statistical framework for modeling **Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)** subtypes — with and without memory impairment — using harmonized data from **HRS-HCAP**, **Mex-Cog**, and **LASI-DAD**.  
It integrates psychometric harmonization with multinomial and ordinal regression modeling to identify robust, culturally generalizable risk patterns.

### 📈 Key Contributions  
- Harmonized demographic and clinical variables (age, rurality, vascular risk, depression) across datasets  
- Constructed derived MCI classification variables based on cognitive domain thresholds and expert consensus  
- Fit and compared multinomial logistic, proportional-odds, and partial-proportional-odds models for 3-class cognitive outcomes  
- Conducted sensitivity analyses addressing skewness, class imbalance, and missingness  
- Developed a reproducible **20+ page R Markdown pipeline** and presented results in weekly cross-institutional meetings
