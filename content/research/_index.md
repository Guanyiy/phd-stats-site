Welcome! 🌱   

I use **data** to understand how systems — from human cognition to behavior and health — change, connect, and tell stories.  
My work bridges *applied statistics* and *machine learning*, combining methodological rigor with questions that matter in the real world.  

I study topics spanning **cognitive aging and dementia measurement** across global cohorts, **behavioral modeling**, and earlier work in **mathematical finance** — all guided by a focus on making data analysis **interpretable**, **equitable**, and **socially meaningful**.
