Welcome! 👋  

My research focuses on the **statistical foundations of cognitive measurement** and the methodological challenges that arise when data are collected across heterogeneous educational, linguistic, and cultural contexts. I work at the intersection of **applied statistics**, **biostatistics**, and **global cognitive aging**, with projects spanning population studies in the United States, Mexico, India, and Nepal.

Across topics, I am especially interested in:

- **Latent variable modeling** (CFA, IRT, WLSMV)
- **Measurement validity & cross-national harmonization**
- **Floor effects, zero inflation, and literacy-linked missingness**
- **Generalized regression modeling** for MCI classification
- **Inference under heterogeneity** in cognitive and aging data
- **Statistical tools that improve interpretability and generalizability**

My goal is to develop and apply statistical methods that remain robust even when data are imperfect, biased, or shaped by structural disparities — ensuring that inference reflects the populations behind the data.
