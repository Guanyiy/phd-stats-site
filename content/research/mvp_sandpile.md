**Period:** Summer 2023

### 📘 Overview  
This project studies the **combinatorial and algorithmic structure** of classical and generalized parking functions through a graph-theoretic lens. We constructed representations linking parking functions to **bipartite graphs**, **sandpile dynamics**, and **chip-firing processes**, and examined how local update rules influence global stability and success probabilities.  

The goal was to understand how algorithmic complexity scales under different preference structures and to explore connections between discrete dynamical systems and combinatorial enumeration.
