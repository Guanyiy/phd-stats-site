**Advisor:** [Dr. Thomas Selig](https://scholar.xjtlu.edu.cn/en/persons/ThomasSelig)

**Period:** Summer 2023

**Overview:**  
This project investigates the combinatorial structure of classical and modified parking functions using graph-theoretic tools. It explores connections with agent-based models and sandpile dynamics, with applications in discrete mathematics and computer simulations.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and simulated 100,000+ parking scenarios using agent-based modeling
- Developed bipartite graph representations and adjacency-based rule variations
- Improved algorithmic efficiency by ~40%
- Co-authored manuscript currently in preparation

**Tools & Methods:** Python, NetworkX, NumPy, Matplotlib
