### 🧩 Overview  
This project contributes to the **psychometric adaptation and validation** of the **Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP)** for use in Nepal, a setting with substantial heterogeneity in literacy, language, and educational exposure.  
We focus on refining visuospatial and attention measures—particularly **Constructional Praxis** and **Symbol Cancellation**—to reduce **floor effects**, improve discriminant validity, and ensure **cross-national comparability** of cognitive functioning and MCI classification.

The broader goal is to build cognitive assessments that remain **interpretable, reliable, and equitable** in low-resource global aging contexts.

### 📈 Key Contributions  
- Led analyses comparing adapted tasks with standard HCAP measures across literacy and education groups, demonstrating **reduced floor effects** and improved measurement precision  
- Evaluated discriminant validity using **two-way ANOVA** and **Aligned Rank Transform (ART) ANOVA** for non-normal outcomes  
- Conducted data cleaning, missingness diagnostics, and scoring harmonization in collaboration with field teams in Kathmandu and Chitwan  
- Integrated findings into the **Nepal HCAP domain structure**, informing downstream MCI modeling and factor scoring  
- Co-authored two abstracts (one first-authored) submitted to the **2026 International Neuropsychological Society (INS)** Annual Meeting
