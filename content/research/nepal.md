🕓 **Period:** *May 2025 – Present*

### 🧩 Overview  
This project contributes to the adaptation and psychometric validation of the **Harmonized Cognitive Assessment Protocol (HCAP)** in Nepal.  
We focus on refining **Constructional Praxis** and **Symbol Cancellation** tasks to improve measurement precision among low-literacy older adults and ensure cross-national comparability of cognitive aging and MCI indicators.

### 📈 Key Contributions  
- Led analyses comparing adapted tasks with standard cognitive measures across education groups, demonstrating reduced floor effects and improved validity  
- Implemented nonparametric ART ANOVA and two-way ANOVA to examine education effects and discriminant validity  
- Conducted data cleaning, missingness evaluation, and scoring harmonization in collaboration with field teams in Nepal  
- Co-authored two abstracts (one first-authored) submitted to the 2026 INS Annual Meeting
