### 🌱 About Me

I’m Guanyi, an applied statistician studying how cognitive data behave across diverse educational and cultural contexts. My training in the University of Michigan’s Applied Statistics program has shaped how I approach scientific questions: not only through prediction, but through attention to identification, measurement structure, and diagnostics.

A recurring theme in my work is that inference depends on the quality of the measurement behind it. Through projects in the U.S., Mexico, India, and Nepal, I became increasingly interested in how floor effects, zero inflation, literacy-linked missingness, and cross-national non-equivalence influence statistical conclusions. These challenges guide my broader interest in methods that connect statistical modeling, psychometrics, and global aging research.

Good measurement, to me, is a commitment to seeing people clearly across context.

### 🧭 What I’m Working On

At the University of Michigan, I work with Dr. Emily Briceño on methods-driven cognitive aging research that integrates population data, statistical modeling, and measurement evaluation.

**🌏 Cross-national cognitive aging (HRS-HCAP, Mex-Cog, LASI-DAD):**  
I analyze Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) subtypes using multinomial regression, generalized linear models, and latent-variable approaches. Much of this work examines measurement comparability across countries—evaluating factor structures, detecting DIF, diagnosing floor effects, and understanding missingness mechanisms that arise from differences in literacy and educational opportunity.

**🇳🇵 Cognitive assessment adaptation in Nepal:**  
I lead analyses for the Nepal HCAP adaptation, refining visuospatial and attention tasks designed for low-literacy older adults. My work includes WLSMV estimation, item-level diagnostics, validity evaluation, and factor score generation for downstream epidemiologic modeling. These efforts reflect my interest in measurement science and inference under data constraints.

### 🔬 Research Interests

- Latent variable modeling: CFA, IRT, factor score estimation  
- Measurement validity and harmonization across populations  
- Regression frameworks for cognitive outcomes  
- Missing data mechanisms and non-ignorable patterns  
- Inference under cultural and educational heterogeneity  
- Applications to cognitive aging and global health

Across methods and applications, I aim to pair rigorous statistical tools with context-aware inference.

### ☕ Beyond the Data

Outside research, I appreciate the slower rhythms that make careful thinking possible—walks, cafés, and music. These routines remind me that statistics is both computational and conceptual: a way of asking precise questions about complex lives and bringing clarity where measurement is difficult but essential.
