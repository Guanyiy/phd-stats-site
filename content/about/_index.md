### 🌱 About Me

I’m **Guanyi**, a statistician-in-training who believes numbers can reveal more than they conceal — *if we ask the right questions.*  

I began in **Financial Mathematics**, drawn to the elegance of formulas and the order of prediction. But as I built models, I realized the world rarely fits the math. Human data isn’t just *noise* — it’s where complexity holds meaning.  

That realization led me toward **cognitive aging** and **psychometrics**, where data meets human difference most directly. Now, as a master’s student in **Applied Statistics** at the **University of Michigan**, I study how people think, age, and adapt across cultures — bridging **statistics**, **cognitive science**, and **global health** to build models that capture both rigor and empathy.  

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #d4d4d4; padding-left: 14px; margin: 1.2em 0; font-style: italic; color: #444;">
Good measurement, to me, is a form of empathy — a way to see people clearly, across differences and contexts.

### 🧭 What I’m Working On

At the **University of Michigan**, I work with **Dr. Emily Briceño** on projects that explore how we measure and model cognition across diverse populations.

**🌏 Cross-National Modeling:**  
Using data from the **HRS-HCAP**, **Mex-Cog**, and **LASI-DAD** studies, I analyze how demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors predict *Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)* subtypes. This work focuses on developing comparable statistical frameworks across countries — bridging differences in measurement, data quality, and cultural context.

**🇳🇵 Adaptation in Nepal:**  
In parallel, I lead analyses for the **Nepal HCAP adaptation**, evaluating cognitive assessments designed for low-literacy and linguistically diverse populations. Our team collaborates with researchers in Nepal to test new visuospatial and attention tasks that improve accessibility and psychometric validity.

From global models to local adaptation, what connects my work is a simple belief:
data should help us see people more clearly, not flatten who they are.

### ☕ Beyond the Data

When I’m not working in R or Mplus, I look for rhythm in small things — the quiet hum of a café, the slow stretch of a walk, a song that makes thinking feel effortless. They remind me that curiosity doesn’t end with research; it lives in how we notice the world.  

Over time, I’ve come to see science not as certainty, but as conversation —  
between data and experience, between precision and empathy.  
And somewhere in that dialogue, meaning quietly begins.
